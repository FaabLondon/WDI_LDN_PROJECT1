# GA WDI-32 Project 1 - Mario coin catcher
For our first project, we were given four days to design and build an in-browser game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery library used). Mario Coin catcher was inspired by the Super Mario Bros. game on the NES console. It features Mario whose goal is to catch as many coins as possible in each level while avoiding getting hit by enemies. It features 4 levels with different game speed and enemies.
